## My Journey: Bridging Multiple Worlds

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Cardiologist, scientist, geneticist, and statistician ... confused
- PhD focused on **mixture models**: like me?
- Medicine and science enhance our understanding of disease
- Combining statistical expertise with clinical experience
- Came to Boston ... Met the best mentors of all time!

## The Statistical Paradox in Medicine

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- One of my first consults as a cardiology fellow revealed a **paradox**:
- A 38-year-old with clear signs of a heart attack
- Yet just a day earlier, they wouldn't have qualified for prevention
- Why? Our reliance on **short-term and narrowly defined risk**
- A fundamental flaw: **current models fail to capture how disease evolves dynamically atop a genetic background**

## The Challenge

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
People develop multiple diseases over their lifetime, but:

- Diseases don't occur in isolation
- Comorbidities follow patterns, but these vary by individual
- Genetics influences these patterns (but isn't destiny)
- Standard approaches miss the dynamic nature of these relationships

To both predict and understand, we need to consider past, present, and future.

**How do we model the complete trajectory of an individual's health, incorporating both genetics and evolving clinical status?**

## What Are "Latent Variables"?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Things we can't directly observe
- Must be inferred from what we can measure
- Examples in everyday life:
  - Intelligence (measured by tests)
  - Happiness (measured by behaviors)
  - Disease patterns (measured by symptoms and test results)
- Powerful statistical concept for finding hidden structure

## A Simple Medical Example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
```
Observable:               Hidden:                  Observable:
                          _________
Fever                    |         |
                   -----> DISEASE  |------> Lab Values  
Cough               |    |_________|    |
                    |                   |
Pain  --------------                    -------> Imaging Findings
```

The disease is a **latent variable** we infer from observable symptoms and test results

## Disease "Signatures"

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
We introduce and define **signatures** as:

- **Latent patterns of disease co-occurrence that vary in time**
- Learned from data in an unsupervised way
- Example signatures:
  - Cardiovascular (hypercholesterolemia → CAD → heart failure)
  - Metabolic (diabetes, obesity, fatty liver)
  - Neoplastic (various cancers, anemia)
- Discovered through statistical methods, not predefined categories

## How Signatures Change Over Time

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
![Diseases don't all happen at once - they follow patterns over time](cvdsig.svg)
:::

## Patient Trajectories Vary

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Patients don't sit still** - their signature profiles change over time:

**Example patient journey:**
- Rheumatologic diagnoses at age 30
- Premature coronary artery disease at age 40
- Increased neoplastic risk by age 50

This story is distinct from other patients, **revealing heterogeneity underlying a shared phenotype**

## Borrowing Information

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Key Statistical Insight:**

We can "borrow information" from similar patients to make better predictions

- If we see Patient A with pattern X develop disease Y
- And Patient B shows early signs of pattern X
- We can better predict B's risk of disease Y

## The Bayesian Approach

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
Mathematical way to update our beliefs as new information arrives:

$$\text{Updated Belief} \propto \text{Prior Knowledge} \times \text{New Data}$$

In practical terms:
- Start with what we know about disease patterns in general
- Update based on this specific patient's data
- Continually refine as more information comes in
:::

::::

## A Simple Bayesian Example

Predicting heart attack risk:

1. **Prior**: 5% of people with high blood pressure have heart attacks
2. **New Data**: Our patient has chest pain
3. **Updated Belief**: Risk is now 15% given both factors

This is "borrowing information" from population studies to help with individual prediction.

## The Mathematical Model (Simplified)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
Turning patient stories into math helps us formalize the problem:

- **ϕ (phi)** - Time-varying disease signatures
  - How different diseases evolve over time within a signature
  - Centered around population incidence

- **λ (lambda)** - Individual's time-varying signature loading
  - Anchored on germline genetic predisposition
  - Shows which signatures are important for a specific person

- Both evolve smoothly over time (using Gaussian processes)
  - Helps us "borrow information" across years

## The Bayesian Magic

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
Our approach works because:

1. We start with prior beliefs (based on population patterns)
2. **Each new diagnosis refines our model parameters in real time**
3. We integrate prior knowledge with patient-specific data
4. The past informs the present, and the present becomes the past to inform the future

Four key innovations:

1. **Bridges discovery and prediction** 
2. **Disease signatures evolve over time and across diseases**
3. **Anchoring in genomics** produces biologically meaningful parameters
4. **Bayesian updating adapts estimates in real time**

- Earlier detection of disease
- More personalized prevention strategies
- Better understanding of disease mechanisms
- Identifying new subtypes of diseases
- Improving clinical trials by targeting the right patients

## Why This Work Matters

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}
This work is the essence of translational medicine:

- Bridges basic, methodologic, and clinical science
- Requires both math and biology appreciation
- Transcends single-discipline medicine
- Transforms how we predict, prevent, and understand disease progression

What statistics has taught me:
- Complex systems can be modeled but require careful assumptions
- Uncertainty should be embraced, not ignored  
- Borrowing information is powerful but must be done carefully
- The best models combine mathematical elegance with real-world knowledge
- Clinical intuition + statistical rigor = better medicine

## Thank You!

Statistics can help us understand health in ways that transform medicine.

(And yes, it's worth learning for your Stat 102 class!)
