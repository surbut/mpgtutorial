::: notes
Like many applicants today, I’m fortunate to bridge multiple
worlds—cardiologist, scientist, geneticist, and statistician. My PhD in
statistics focused on mixture models, elegant frameworks for combining
different distributions to describe natural phenomena—much like how
medicine and science enhance our understanding of disease. One of my
first consults as a cardiology fellow revealed a paradox that struck me
as a statistician: A 38-year-old with clear signs and symptoms of an MI,
wouldn’t have qualified for primary prevention just a day earlier due to
our reliance on short-term and narrowly defined risk. This highlighted a
fundamental flaw: current models fail to capture how disease evolves
dynamically atop a genetic background. To both predict and understand,
we need to consider past, present, and future. Patients interact with
multiple specialties in their lifetime, revealing patterns across
diseases and time. Driven by clinical urgency yet informed by
statistical intuition, I set out to build a model from the groud up.

## The Challenge

::::: columns
:::: {.column width="100%"}
People develop multiple diseases over their lifetime, but:

-   Diseases don't occur in isolation
-   Comorbidities follow patterns, but these vary by individual
-   Genetics influences these patterns (but isn't destiny)
-   Standard approaches miss the dynamic nature of these relationships

## What Are "Latent Variables"?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Things we can't directly observe
-   Must be inferred from what we can measure
-   Examples in everyday life:
    -   Intelligence (measured by tests)
    -   Happiness (measured by behaviors)
    -   Disease patterns (measured by symptoms and test results)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](latent-variable-diagram.svg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
We introduce and define signatures as latent patterns of disease
co-occurrence that vary in time at a population level. These signatures
are learned from the data in an unsupervised way, providing targets for
both discovery and prediction.
:::

## A Simple Medical Example

:::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
```         
Observable:               Hidden:                  Observable:
                          _________
Fever                    |         |
                   -----> DISEASE  |------> Lab Values  
Cough               |    |_________|    |
                    |                   |
Pain  --------------                    -------> Imaging Findings
```

The disease is a **latent variable** we infer from observable symptoms
and test results

## Understanding Latent Variables

![](images/pc-comparison-diagram.svg){width="600"}

::: notes
When two (or more) biomarkers are highly correlated, they contain
partially redundant information. Find the direction that maximizes
variation, which often means combining information from both markers,
resolving more differences than either alone. This is why these
statistical techniques are so powerful for medical applications. Rather
than looking at dozens of individual biomarkers in isolation, you can
create composite scores that capture more of the underlying biological
signal (like cardiac damage) Reduce noise by combining multiple
measurements and create better separation between patients with
different disease severity this concept extends beautifully to
time-varying data, binary outcomes, and the complex patterns of
comorbidities with Aladynoulli model!

## Disease "Signatures"

We introduce and define **signatures** as:

-   **Latent patterns of disease co-occurrence that vary in time**
-   Learned from data in an unsupervised way
-   Example signatures:
    -   Cardiovascular (hypercholesterolemia → CAD → heart failure)
    -   Metabolic (diabetes, obesity, fatty liver)
    -   Neoplastic (various cancers, anemia)
-   Discovered through statistical methods, not predefined categories

::: notes
Within each signature, diseases appear with characteristic incidence and
timing. For example, our method learns an ischemic cardiovascular
signature, in which hypercholesterolemia → CAD → CHF. Through the magic
that is matrix decomposition, signatures reveal natural patterns but
require no prespecified guidance.

## How Signatures Change Over Time

::: {.column width="100%"}
![Diseases don't all happen at once - they follow patterns over
time](cvdsig.svg)
:::
::::

## Patient Trajectories Vary

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Patients don't sit still** - their signature profiles change over
time:

**Example patient journey:** - Rheumatologic diagnoses at age 30 -
Premature coronary artery disease at age 40 - Increased neoplastic risk
by age 50

This story is distinct from other patients, **revealing heterogeneity
underlying a shared phenotype**
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](patient-trajectory-diagram.svg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
But patients don’t sit still – the relative loading or importance of a
signature to a patient depends on when the question is asked. Example:
Our patient may have rheumatologic diagnoses at 30, develop premature
CAD at 40, and by 50, increased neoplastic risk. This story is distinct
from another patient revealing heterogeneity underlying a shared
phenotype. turning this patient story into math can help us formalize
the discussion into a solvable problem with a few key parameters
:::

## Borrowing Information

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Key Statistical Insight:**

We can "borrow information" from similar patients to make better
predictions

-   If we see Patient A with pattern X develop disease Y
-   And Patient B shows early signs of pattern X
-   We can better predict B's risk of disease Y

## The Bayesian Approach

:::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
Mathematical way to update our beliefs as new information arrives:

$$\text{Updated Belief} \propto \text{Prior Knowledge} \times \text{New Data}$$

In practical terms:

**Start with what we know about disease patterns in general**

**Update based on this specific patient's data**

**Continually refine as more information comes in**
:::
::::

## A Simple Bayesian Example

Predicting heart attack risk:

1.  **Prior**: 5% of people with high blood pressure have heart attacks
2.  **New Data**: Our patient has chest pain
3.  **Updated Belief**: Risk is now 15% given both factors

This is "borrowing information" from population studies to help with
individual prediction.

## The Mathematical Model (Simplified)

Turning patient stories into math helps us formalize the problem:

-   **ϕ (phi)** - Time-varying disease signatures
    -   How different diseases evolve over time within a signature
    -   Centered around population incidence
-   **λ (lambda)** - Individual's time-varying signature loading
    -   Anchored on germline genetic predisposition
    -   Shows which signatures are important for a specific person

::: notes
ϕ (phi) represents the time varying signatures, where each signature
demonstrates how different diseases evolve over time, centered around
population incidence (mu) and a term relating the importance of the
signature to the disease (psid) λ represents an individual’s time
varying loading, anchored on their germline genetic predisposition Both
evolve smoothly over time as captured in their covariance matrix, which
helps us borrow information across years.

## The Bayesian Magic

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Our approach works because:

1.  We start with prior beliefs (based on population patterns)
2.  **Each new diagnosis refines our model parameters in real time**
3.  We integrate prior knowledge with patient-specific data
4.  The past informs the present, and the present becomes the past to
    inform the future
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](bayesian-updating-diagram.svg)
:::
:::::

::: notes
Before encountering data, these serve as our prior beliefs And herein
lies the Bayesian magic —each new diagnosis refines these key parameters
in real time, integrating prior knowledge with patient-specific data
(point to bayes rule) we then combine these parameters across
signatures, generating disease probabilities, to also help predict the
future. This is a key innovation that separates the Aladynoulli
approach, and stems from its Bernoulli parameterization Returning to our
pt, this feature could mean the difference between prevention and
emergency intervention"
:::

## Four key innovations:

1.  **Bridges discovery and prediction**
2.  **Disease signatures evolve over time and across diseases**
3.  **Anchoring in genomics** produces biologically meaningful
    parameters
4.  **Bayesian updating adapts estimates in real time**

::: notes
The novelty in our approach parallels our patient’s walk in 4 key ways:
\*First, our model bridges discovery and prediction, by discovering
latent disease signatures that also combine to form individualized
predictions. Second, our disease signatures evolve over time and across
disease, expanding the dimension of shared biology. Third, anchoring
individual loadings in genomics ensures that our model produces
biologically informed parameters rather than ML artifacts, which enables
targeted precision treatment strategies. And finally, Bayesian updating
adapts estimates in real time, jointly refining our understanding of the
population and the individual. Our 38-year-old patient’s past informs
the present, and the present becomes the past to inform the future.

## Why This Work Matters

:::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
This work is the essence of translational medicine:

-   Bridges basic, methodologic, and clinical science
-   Requires both math and biology appreciation
-   Transcends single-discipline medicine
-   Transforms how we predict, prevent, and understand disease
    progression

What statistics has taught me: - Complex systems can be modeled but
require careful assumptions - Uncertainty should be embraced, not
ignored - Borrowing information is powerful but must be done carefully -
The best models combine mathematical elegance with real-world
knowledge - Clinical intuition + statistical rigor = better medicine
